Title: Intraclass Correlations for Quantifying Inter-Rater Reliability   
Version: 2.0

Description: A series of R functions are made available for calculating various intraclass correlation coefficients used to quantify 
  inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.  The assumption here is that the raters produced quantitative ratings. Most of the 
  statistical procedures implemented in this package are described in details in Gwet, K.L. (2021): Handbook of Inter-Rater 
  Reliability - 5th ed. Volume 2: Analysis of Quantitative Ratings. AgreeStat Analytics.
