\title{Scores assigned by 3 raters to 4 subjects.}
\format{
This dataset has 4 rows (for the 4 subjects) and 4 columns. All 4 columns are mandatory when using the ICC functions of
this package. Rater3 only rated 2 of the 4 subjects (i.e. subjects 2 and 3), while each of the other raters rated all 4 subjects.
Therefore, some missing ratings in the form of "NA" appear in the column associated with the Rater3.
 \describe{
    \item{Subject}{This variable represents the target or subject number and may contain duplicate value to indicate multiple ratings assigned to the same subjects by the same judge}
    \item{Rater1}{All ratings from judge 1}
    \item{Rater2}{All ratings from judge 2}
    \item{Rater3}{All ratings from judge 3}
