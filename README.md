# Abstract

**irrICC** is an R package that provides several functions for
calculating various Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). This
package follows closely the general framework of inter-rater and
intra-rater reliability presented by Gwet (2014).

All input datasets to be used with this package must contain a mandatory
“Target” column of all subjects that were rated, and 2 or more columns
“Rater1”, “Rater2”, …. showing the ratings assigned to the subjects. The
Target variable mus represent the first column of the data frame, and
every other column is assumed to contained ratings from a rater. Note
that all ratings must be numeric values for the ICC to be calculated.
For example, here is a dataset “iccdata1” that is included in this
package:

      iccdata1
    #>    Target   J1  J2  J3 J4
    #> 1       1  6.0 1.0 3.0  2
    #> 2       1  6.5  NA 3.0  4
    #> 3       1  4.0 3.0 5.5  4
    #> 4       5 10.0 5.0 6.0  9
    #> 5       5  9.5 4.0  NA  8
    #> 6       4  6.0 2.0 4.0 NA
    #> 7       4   NA 1.0 3.0  6
    #> 8       4  8.0 2.5  NA  5
    #> 9       2  9.0 2.0 5.0  8
    #> 10      2  7.0  NA 2.0  6
    #> 11      2  8.0  NA 2.0  7
    #> 12      3 10.0 5.0 6.0 NA

The first column “Taget” (the name Target can be replaced with any other
name you like) contains subject identifiers, while J1, J2, J3, J4 are
the 4 raters (referred to here as Judges) and the ratings they assigned
to the subjects. You will notice that the Target column contains
duplicates, indicating that some subjects were rated multiple times.
Moreover, none of these judges rated all subjects as seen by the
presencce of missing ratings identified with the symbol NA.

Two other datasets, iccdata2, and iccdata3 come with the package for you
to experiment with. Even if your data frame contains several variuables,
note that only the Target and the Rater columns must be supplied as
parameters to the functions. For example the iccdata2 data frame
contains a variable named Group, which indicates the specific group each
Target is categorized. It must be excluded from the input dataset as
follows: iccdata2\[,2:6\].

 

# Computing various ICC values

To determine what function you need, you must first have a statistical
description of experimental data. There are essentially 3 statistical
models recommended in the literature for describing quantitative
inter-rater reliability data. These are commonly refer to as model 1,
model 2 and model 3.

-   **Model 1**  
    Model 1 is uses a single factor (hence the number 1) to explain the
    variation in the ratings. When the factor used is the subject then
    the model is referred to as Model 1A and when it is the rater the
    model is named Model 1B. You will want to use Model 1A if not all
    subjects are rated by the same roster of raters. That raters may
    change from subject to subject. Model 1B is more indicated if
    different raters may rate different rosters of subjects. Note that
    while Model 1A only allows for the calculation of inter-rater
    reliability, Model 1B on the other hand only allows for the
    calculation of intra-rater reliability.

> Calculating the ICC under Model 1A is done as follows:

      icc1a.fn(iccdata1)
    #>      sig2s    sig2e     icc1a n r max.rep min.rep Mtot ov.mean
    #> 1 1.761312 5.225529 0.2520899 5 4       3       1   40     5.2

> It follows that the inter-rater reliability is given by 0.252, the
> first 2 output statistics being the subject variance component 1.761
> and error variance component 5.226 respectively. You may see a
> description of the other statistics from the function’s documentation.
>
> The ICC under Model 1B is calculated as follows:

      icc1b.fn(iccdata1)
    #>     sig2r    sig2e     icc1b n r max.rep min.rep Mtot ov.mean
    #> 1 4.32087 3.365846 0.5621217 5 4       3       1   40     5.2

> It follows that the intra-rater reliability is given by 0.562, the
> first 2 output statistics being the rater variance component 4.321 and
> error variance component 3.366 respectively. A description of the
> other statistics can be found in the function’s documentation.

-   **Model 2**  
    Model 2 includes a subject and a rater factors, both of which are
    considered random. That is, Model 2 is a pure random factorial ANOVA
    model. You may have Model 2 with a subject-rater interaction and
    Model 2 without subject-rater interaction. Model 2 with
    subject-rater interaction is made up of 3 factors: the rater,
    subject and interaction factors, and is implemented in the function
    *icc2.inter.fn*.  
    For information, the mathematical formulation of the full Model 2 is
    *y*<sub>*i**j**k*</sub> = *μ* + *s*<sub>*i*</sub> + *r*<sub>*j*</sub> + (*s**r*)<sub>*i**j*</sub> + *e*<sub>*i**j**k*</sub>,
    where *y*<sub>*i**j**k*</sub> is the rating associated with subject
    *i*, rater *j* and replicate (or measurement) *k*. Moreover, *μ* is
    the average rating, *s*<sub>*i*</sub> subject *i*’s effect,
    *r*<sub>*j*</sub> rater *j*’s effect, (*s**r*)<sub>*i**j*</sub>
    subject-rater interaction effect associated with subject *i* and
    rater *j*, and *e*<sub>*i**j**k*</sub> is the error effect. The
    other statistical models are similar to this one. Some may be based
    on fewer factors or the assumptions applicable to these factors may
    vary from model to model. Please read Gwet (2014) for a technical
    discussion of these models.

> Calculating the ICC from the iccdata1 dataset (included in this

      icc2.inter.fn(iccdata1)
    #>      sig2s    sig2r    sig2e    sig2sr    icc2r     icc2a n r max.rep min.rep
    #> 1 2.018593 4.281361 1.315476 0.4067361 0.251627 0.8360198 5 4       3       1
    #>   Mtot ov.mean
    #> 1   40     5.2

> The ICC calculation with the iccdata1 dataset and under the assumption

      icc2.nointer.fn(iccdata1)
    #>      sig2s   sig2r    sig2e     icc2r    icc2a n r max.rep min.rep Mtot ov.mean
    #> 1 2.090769 4.34898 1.598313 0.2601086 0.801157 5 4       3       1   40     5.2

> The 2 intraclass correlation coefficients have now become *icc2r*=0.26
> and *icc2a*=0.801. That is the estimated inter-rater reliability
> slightly went up while the intra-rater reliability coefficient
> slightly went down.

-   **Model 3**  
    To calcule the ICC using the iccdata1 dataset and under the
    assumption of Model 3 with interaction, you should proceed as
    follows:

<!-- -->

      icc3.inter.fn(iccdata1)
    #>      sig2s    sig2e    sig2sr     icc2r     icc2a n r max.rep min.rep Mtot
    #> 1 2.274732 1.315476 0.2007963 0.5823786 0.6530007 5 4       3       1   40
    #>   ov.mean
    #> 1     5.2

> Here, the 2 intraclass correlation coefficients are given by *icc2r* =
> 0.582 and *icc2a* = 0.653. The estimated inter-rater reliability went
> up substantially while the intra-rater reliability coefficient went
> down substantially compared to Model 2 with interaction.  
> Assuming Model 3 without interaction, the same coefficients are
> calculated as follows:

      icc3.nointer.fn(iccdata1)
    #>      sig2s    sig2e     icc2r     icc2a n r max.rep min.rep Mtot ov.mean
    #> 1 2.241792 1.470638 0.6038611 0.6038611 5 4       3       1   40     5.2

> It follows that the 2 ICCs are given by *icc2r* = 0.604 and *icc2a* =
> 0.604. As usual, the omission of an interaction factor leads to a
> slight increase in inter-rater reliability and a slight descrease in
> intra-rater reliability. In this case, both become identical.
